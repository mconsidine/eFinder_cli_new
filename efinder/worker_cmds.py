"""
Internal command types between comms and worker processes.

Different from maint.py: maint.py is the JSON wire protocol on the
maintenance Unix socket. This module defines the in-process queue
messages that comms uses to ask camera_proc and solver_proc to do
things on its behalf.

Why a separate layer: a maintenance command might need to touch
multiple workers, or might be answerable by comms alone, or might
trigger a sequence of actions. The maintenance handler is the right
place to know that; the workers shouldn't.
